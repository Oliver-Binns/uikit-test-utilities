# TestUtilities

A light-weight package which makes it easier to unit test your code while keeping implementation details (IBOutlet, IBAction) private.

Import this package into your unit test target to allow you to more easily test `UIAlertAction`s, `UIBarButtonItem` and more.
This package contains some private APIs and should not be imported into your main application bundle or submitted to any Apple App Store as it will likely be rejected.

See the unit tests in the package for example usage. A full tutorial on using this code is available on my website.
